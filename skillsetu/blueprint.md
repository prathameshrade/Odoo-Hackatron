## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080) to convey trust, competence, and a sense of community and collaboration, subtly alluding to shared skills.
- Background color: Very light grayish teal (#E0F8F8) to provide a calm, neutral backdrop that complements the primary color without overwhelming it.
- Accent color: Soft lime green (#BFFF00) to draw attention to key actions such as request buttons, acceptance alerts, and new message notifications. The lime green provides visual pop against the teal background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, clean, and readable appearance.
- Use a consistent set of icons from a modern icon set, emphasizing clarity and ease of recognition.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with clear divisions between sections.
- Incorporate subtle animations, like smooth transitions on navigation and interactive elements.
